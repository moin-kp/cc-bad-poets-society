   - AI tool used: [Which tool?]
   - Result: [Describe the presentation]

2. **Poem 2:**
   ```
   [Paste full text of poem 2]
   ```
   - Presentation method: [e.g., ElevenLabs audio]
   - Why this poem: [Why did you choose it?]
   - AI tool used: [Which tool?]
   - Result: [Describe the presentation]

3. **Poem 3:**
   ```
